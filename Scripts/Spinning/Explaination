1. local spinningPart = script.Parent:

This grabs the part the script is attached to and stores it in the spinningPart variable.

2. while true do:

This creates an infinite loop that keeps running the code inside it.

3. spinningPart.CFrame = spinningPart.CFrame * CFrame.Angles(0, math.rad(5), 0):

This spins the part 5 degrees around the Y-axis (vertical rotation) every time it runs.

4. wait(0.1):

Pauses the script for 0.1 seconds before spinning the part again.
