Explanation:

teleportPart: The part that the player touches to trigger the teleportation.

targetPart: The part where the player will be teleported. Make sure this is properly defined in the workspace (e.g., named TeleportTarget).

The script listens for the Touched event and checks if the touching object is a player by looking for a Humanoid.

If the object has a Humanoid, the script teleports the player's HumanoidRootPart to the targetPart's location.
